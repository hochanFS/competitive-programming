# Competitive Programming

This repository contains the code I wrote for various coding competitions, including:
1. <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam">Google Code Jam</a>
2. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hackercup/">Facebook Hacker Cup</a>
3. <a href="https://codeforces.com/">Code Forces</a>

The primary purpose of this repository is to save the resources in case someone, or future me, wants to solve or revisit an old problem for improving programming skills.
